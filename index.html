    <p>The Farnsworth House, built between 1945 and 1951 for Dr. Edith Farnsworth as a weekend retreat, 
      is a platonic perfection of order gently placed in spontaneous nature in Plano, Illinois. 
      Just right outside of Chicago in a 10-acre secluded wooded site with the Fox River to the south, 
      the glass pavilion takes full advantage of relating to its natural surroundings, achieving Mies' 
      concept of a strong relationship between the house and nature.</p>

    <p>Five decades ago, Carole Smith called Richard Meier and told him about a site in Darien, 
      Connecticut that she had bought with her husband. This was a rocky piece of land with 
      dense evergreens and coastal outcrops. A dramatic slope at the back of the plot gave way 
      to the Long Island Sound and a small, sandy cove. Carole wanted to place her weekend home 
      on this particular site and she wanted Richard Meier to do it. At that time, he was just 31.</p>
